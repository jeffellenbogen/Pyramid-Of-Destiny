# Pyramid-Of-Destiny

This repository is an attempt to bring together multiple code experiments to light a 32x32 RGB matrix with an Arduino Mega that has as custom soldered shield to connect the Arduino to the matrix and also includes a potentiometer to allow for adjustments to the LEDs as well as an audio sound sensor from Sparkfun. I plan to add a push button so that these separate arduino sketches can be merged into one with various modes trigger via a button.
